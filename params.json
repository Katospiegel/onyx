{"name":"Onyx","tagline":"miRNA Differential Expression Analysis Pipeline","body":"## What is Onyx?\r\n\r\nOnyx allows the annotation and calculus of know miRNA differential expression levels from High-Throughput sequencing data.This Pipeline consist in Quality Analysis, Trimming, Mapping, Annotation and Expression Analysis.According with the studies puublished It is compatible with match-pair and non match-pair experimental design. The output is a summary of the normalized levels (TMM), the log Fold Change (logFC), the P Value, and the False Discovery Rate (FDR).\r\n\r\n##Pipeline Overview\r\n\r\n![Pipeline Overview](http://s1.postimg.org/t43cuao3z/onyxpip.png)\r\n\r\n##How to use Onyx?\r\n\r\nJust execute the onyx script after configuration the config file.\r\n```\r\n$ bash onyx.sh config.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"35874771","note":"Don't delete this file!
